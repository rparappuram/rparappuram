Hi There! :wave:

My name is Ryan and I'm really passionate about programming. I'm a sophomore CS major at UT Austin, and I plan to graduate by the end of 2024.

Reach out to me if you want work done or want to collaborate. I'm always willing to learn!

# A Little About Me :boy:

My main goal is to become an A.I. Software Engineer. I've used many different programming languages and frameworks, but, to summarize, here are a few.

* I have extensive experience with Java and ReactJS, and I'm proficient in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and C.
* Now I'm expanding my skillset in back end programming with Go, Java, and Spring Framework.

That doesn't mean I won't continue with my current expertise; I'm excited to work with everyone on everything!
