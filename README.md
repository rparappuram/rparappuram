Hi There! :wave:

My name is Ryan and I'm really passionate about AI. I'm a junior CS major at UT Austin graduating in May 2025.


# A Little About Me :boy:

I'm on an exciting journey as a Software Engineer, continuously sharpening my coding skills and building a diverse tech stack. My experience covers a wide range of programming languages, from Python, C/C++, and Java to JavaScript, GoLang, PHP, and SQL.

In the realm of web development, I've tinkered with HTML/CSS, Flask, Spring Boot, Next.js, and React. Meanwhile, my adventures in the cloud have led me through AWS, Google Cloud Platform, DigitalOcean, to Kubernetes and Docker.

One of my proudest achievements is the 'pintOS' project, completed during my tenure at UTCS, where I implemented several kernel modules, including basic interrupts, thread schedulers, user process handling, and an FFS-based fully functional file system.

While these experiences have shaped me, I am far from done. Looking forward to learning more!
